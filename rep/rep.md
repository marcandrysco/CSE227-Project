# Introduction

While more and more applications transition from the desktop to the web,
many of the security and privacy features provided that were once taken for
granted by the operating system are lagging behind. Recent additions to web
browsers include support for: WebGL, canvas, video and audio tags, WebSockets,
CSS3, and Local Storage. These features are motivated by the needs of
application developer needs without necessarily thoroughly scrutinized for
security. With the rapid pace of development of web standards, these
technologies have not been given the time to find a correct the existing bugs.

Prior work to find bugs in web technologies has already yielded a fair number
of tools. In particular, fuzz testing frameworks attempt find unexpected
behavior by randomly generating unexpected input vectors. The Chrome
developers have written the fuzzing tool [ClusterFuzz] for continuous
integration of the Chrome browser, searching for regressions as they occur.
The [Javascript-fuzz] tool generates a wide range of random Javascript values
covering the ECMAScript 5.1 standard. The [JSFunFuzz] tool was written by the
Mozzila developers for fuzz testing the Firefox javascript engine.

These have focused on previously untested portions of web standard, especially
on Javascript, which rapidly became the core programming language of the web.
Our tool provides a framework for fuzz testing media content with a focus on the
audio and video tags. Unlike generalized fuzz testing tools, our tool targets
the audio and video tags with randomized data, both generated structurally
from the media format specifications and by corrupted otherwise valid,
properly handled media files. Using our techniques, we are able to exercise
critical bugs, allowing a malicious website to crash the browser and sometimes
even crash the entire operating system. These bugs warrant further
investigation as they may be attack vectors for exploits.

# Overview
This is the overview. It describes at a high level what we did.

# What do we call this section?
This is the technical section. It goes into detail.

All pages are deterministically generated via a seed parameter that can
be passed to the page. The seed allows the user to reproduce crashes
given a fixed seed; however, crashes due to race conditions or timing
bugs are frequently not deterministic, and create bugs that are
difficult to reproduce. All references to randomly generated data refer
to random generation based on this fixed seed.

User-land crashes are detected and analyzed by running the browser under a
debugger.

## Random Page Layout

In order to stress the web rendering engine, web pages are constructed with a
random layout, nesting elements appropriately, generating on the order of one
hundred video and audio tags for a single page. After an interval of twenty
seconds, the page is updated, randomly selecting elements for removing and
replacing them with new content containing additional media elements. This
process is repeated until the page is terminated or a bug causes the page to
crash.

The pages are generated with numerous random properties set for every element,
generating media tags to be overlapping with a variety of position, opacity,
and styling attributes. Creating elements in this way allows the web page to
stress the rendering engine and hopes to discover issues arising from media
content layed out in an unexpected fashion.

## Structured Random Audio Media


## Corrupted Audio and Video Media

Corrupted media is generated based on valid media files to generate introduce
subtle errors in what would otherwise be a valid file. 

# Evaluation

Using our framework for fuzzing data inputs, we were able to trigger a wide
range of crashing bugs. In particular, we noticed that MPEG-4 video files
caused the largest number of bugs, likely due to the video format's
complexity. Firefox was especially vulnerable to crashing when parsing corrupt
video data on all platforms. After filtering out videos that expose crashes,
our framework caused Firefox to quickly consume all available memory. Crashes
were less reliable on Chrome; typically, the isolated tab would crash,
although there were a few instances where the entire browser was taken down.
On the other hand, our testing was never able to cause crashes or memory leaks
in Internet Explorer.

## Firefox Metadata Segfault

Specific types of corruption of MPEG-4 video files causes an immediate crash
of Firefox. Our investigation of the bug revealed that an uninitialized
pointer is passed to the free function, causing a segmentation fault. In our
limited testing, we were unable to determine if an attacker could control the
unitialized pointer value in order to perform a remote exploit. Even without
the ability to control the pointer value, an malicious website can easily
crash the Firefox, closing all open windows and tabs.

```c
GError* error;
gchar* debug;
gst_message_parse_error(message, &error, &debug);
//...
g_error_free(error);
g_free(debug);
```

We traced the bug down to the previous code. In particular, the debug pointer
is uninitialized before the call to `gst_message_parse_error`. The
documentation states that "the values returned in the output arguments are
copies; the caller must free them when done." However, calling
`gst_message_parse_error` on the specially crafted MPEG-4 file prevents the
call from ever writing to debug and the unitialized value is then passed to
`g_free`. The allocator attempts to free the value, causing the segmentation
fault.

## Mac OS X Kernel Panic

Running our framework using Firefox in Mac OS X causes a kernel panic that
forces the user to reboot the entire system. The panic occurs while executing
privileged code in a sandboxed process dedicated to decoding video. Our
analysis found that the panic only occurs when simultaneously attempting to
play hundreds of corrupt video files simultaneously. This leads us to believe
that the bug is caused by a race condition when subjecting the sandboxed
process with a heavy load.

When inspecting the resulting kernel panic, we noticed that error code varied
between a general protection fault or a page fault. Typically, the instruction
pointer was set to either the value `0x0000000000000000` or
`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` indicating an invalid jump or return. While the error was
very quick to reproduce, only requiring a few seconds, we were unable to find a
reliable method of producing identical kernel panics. Because this crash
affect privileged code, we find the bug particularly worrisome and plan to
investigate further.
